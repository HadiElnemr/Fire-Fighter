# Run

To run the web page, you need to have XAMPP installed and run Apache. Move the project folder to xampp/htdocs. Open a browser and type <b><i>localhost:"port ex:8080"/"project_name"</i></b>, so type <i><b>localhost/nasa</i></b> for example. From the folders that will appear, choose <b><i>"nasa"</i></b> and the intro page should appear. You can now walk yourself through the project.
